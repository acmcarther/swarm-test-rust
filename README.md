## Purpose
This is intended to be an intro to Rust lang for myself, as well as a technical demo of large scale entity coordination. Most of the work here will be prepwork, as I'm not using any prebuilt engines.

## Dependencies
The project is currently integrating [GFX-RS](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs) for its graphics components.
